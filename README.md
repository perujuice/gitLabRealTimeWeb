# B3 Production

### URL to the server
<a>https://cscloud9-62.lnu.se/</a>


## Basic Requirements Implemented

*To run locally, simply run the following command:*

```sh
npm install
npm start # runs in production (NODE_ENV)
```

**But this will not work for real time web, that only works on the production server!**

## Extra requirements

- I implemented a richer UI
- Implemented a button to close an issue
